The following is the introduction of reproduction number in [@cori2013new].

#### Definition of reproduction number (R)

An average number of secondary cases of disease caused by a single infected individual over his or her infectious period. time and situation specific. indicatiing pathogen transmissibility during an epidemic.

#### Why need to monitor R 

It provides feedback on the effectiveness of interventions and on the need of additional controlling efforts. The goal of epidemic control is to reduce R below 1 and make it as close to 0 as possible.

#### Methods to estimate R

* Transmission modeling to incidence data: model assumption dependent (e.g., presence/absence of a latency period or size of the population studied)

* Statistical modeling by [@wallinga2004different]: taking 1) incidence data and 2) the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms of secondary cases).

* [@cori2013new] tried to make the estimate more generic and robust.

The estimate of R at time t requires incidence data from times later than t, thus data are right censored. Improving the accuracy of R estimate, either using a short data collection time or applying smoothing, which demand substantial knowledge and efforts.
